# üå¶Ô∏è WeatherLinkIP to InfluxDB Exporter

A WeatherLinkIP is a discontinued data logger for a Davis weather station, this project uses the work done by [ae-11](https://github.com/ae-11/WeatherLinkIP_Py) to get the data from the station and then capture it to an InfluxDB.

## Deployment

Currently you need to run `PublishData.py` script on a cronjob to get it to automatically collect data every minute, but this will eventually be converted into a Docker image.

First you need to make a copy of the `.env.example` file which is named `.env`. This should then be filled will the relevant information. Then add a cronjob task to run the `run.sh` file every minute (the `run.sh` file will ensure that the environment values are passed to the python script.)

You will then need to configure [InfluxDB2](https://www.influxdata.com/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (for prettier dashboards). Here is a sample Docker Compose file to bring up those services.

You should update the credentials for InfluxDB before you start the container. Grafana will ask you to change your credentials the first time you login (the default values are `admin`:`admin`).

```yaml
